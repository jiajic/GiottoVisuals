  img_border = 0.125,
  flex_resample = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{img}{giotto image to plot}

\item{plot_ext}{extent of plot (required)}

\item{img_border}{if not 0 or FALSE, expand plot_ext by this percentage on
each side before applying crop on image. See details}

\item{flex_resample}{logical. Default = TRUE. Forces usage of method A when
FALSE.}

\item{max_sample}{numeric. Default = 5e5. Maximum n values to sample from the
image. If larger than \code{max_crop}, will override \code{max_crop.}
Globally settable with the option "giotto.plot_img_max_sample"}

\item{max_crop}{numeric. Default = 1e8. Maximum crop size (px area) allowed
for \strong{method A} before switching to \strong{method B}
(see description).
Globally settable with option "giotto.plot_img_max_crop"}

\item{max_resample_scale}{numeric. Default = 100. Maximum scalefactor allowed
to be applied on \code{max_sample} in order to oversample when compensating
for decreased resolution when cropping after sampling. Globally settable with
option "giotto.plot_img_max_resample_scale".}

a giotto image cropped and resampled properly for plotting

\description{
Downsample terra-based images for plotting. Uses
\code{\link[terra]{spatSample}} to load onlya  portion of the original image,
speeding up plotting and lowering memory footprint.

Default behavior of \code{spatSample} is to crop if only a smaller ROI is
needed for plotting followed by the sampling process in order to reduce
wasted sampling by focusing the sample space. For very large ROIs, this
crop can be time intensive and require writing to disk.

This function examines the ROI dimensions as defined through the limits of
the spatial locations to be plotted, and decides between the following two
methods in order to avoid this issue:
\itemize{
\item{\strong{Method A.} First crop original image, then sample
\code{max_sample} (default = 5e5) values to generate final image. Intended
for smaller ROIs. Force usage of this method by setting
\code{flex_resample = FALSE}}
\item{\strong{Method B.} First oversample, then crop. Intended for larger
ROIs. Base sample size is \code{max_sample}, which is then multiplied by a
scale factor >1 that increases the smaller the ROI is and is defined by:
original dimensions/crop dimensions where the larger ratio between x
and y dims is chosen. Scale factor is capped by
\code{max_resample_scale}}
}
Control points for this function are set by \code{max_crop} which decides
the max ROI area after which switchover to method B happens in order to
avoid laborious crops and \code{max_resample_scale} which determines the
maximum scale factor for number of values to sample. Both values can be
adjusted depending on system resources. Additionally, \code{flex_resample}
determines if this switching behavior happens.
When set to \code{FALSE}, only method A is used.

\details{
\strong{img_border}
expand ext to use for plotting the image. This makes it so that the image
is not cut off sharply at the edge of the plot extent. Needed since plots
often define extent by centroids, and polygons may hang over the edge of the
extent.
